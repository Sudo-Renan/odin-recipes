    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk,
        cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. 
        Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Evaporated milk: This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.</li>

        <li>Sweetened condensed milk: Sweetened condensed milk makes everything more delicious, including this coquito recipe!</li>
        <li> White rum: The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li>
